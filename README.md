# Optimising Interaction with Teravoxel Images / 2019-2020 Summer Project at ABI

## Background
High-resolution imaging using a custom-built microscope yields 3D images with sizes up to a terabyte.  Such images may have up to 4 channels, and dimensions around 40k x 10k x 2k, at 16-bit resolution.  This project seeked to develop efficient storage formats together with software for real-time interaction with the image volume. The approach taken was to construct a hierarchical data structure with information stored at multiple resolutions (Essentially, 3D Google Maps for cells).

This repository holds resources for the Summer Project 'Optimising Interaction with Teravoxel Images' done across the summer of 2019-2020 at ABI. There is one file containing the functions of the package and three files which were used for benchmark testing.
